# Hey, I'm Nate!

### I build beautiful, intuitive CLI tools to empower fellow creative coders as part of [Bombshell](https://github.com/bombshell-dev).

Currently, senior design engineer at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Previously, I co-created [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) as a founding engineer at [The Astro Technology Company](https://astro.build/blog/the-astro-technology-company/). Before that, I built [Microsite](https://github.com/natemoo-re/microsite), the first web framework for [islands architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/).

My passion for building high-polish, delightful devtools is informed by my background in print design, desire to sweat the details, and refusal to settle for tools that can only be described as "good enough".

**Radically empathetic technology illuminates our path towards a more just future.**
